# Resume-Analyser
This tool ranks resume according to their compatibility to the job description.

 Hiring managers receive thousands of resumes, making manual screening inefficient. An AI-powered Resume Screening Tool can automate the process, improving speed and accuracy.
This tool extracts relevant information from resumes and filters candidates based on job requirements
Our Python-powered resume review tool leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze resumes and match them to job requirements. 
By automating this process, we can save time, reduce bias, and make more informed hiring decisions.
